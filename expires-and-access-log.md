```nginx
location /static/ {
    alias /var/www/static_files/;
    expires 30d;
    access_log off;
}
```
#### 1. `expires 30d;`
- **Purpose**: This directive tells Nginx to add an `Expires` header to the response, instructing browsers to cache the static files for a specified duration.
- **Functionality**: The `30d` means that the browser should cache the response for **30 days**.
  
  - **Benefit**: Caching static resources (like images, CSS, and JavaScript) can significantly improve load times and reduce server load because it minimizes the number of requests sent to the server.
  
  - **Result**: When the client accesses the static files, the browser will not request them from the server again until the 30-day period has passed, unless the cache is cleared or expires.

#### 2. `access_log off;`
- **Purpose**: This directive disables logging of access requests for this location.
  
  - **Reason**: You might want to turn off access logging for static file requests to reduce the size of log files and improve performance, especially if these requests are frequent (e.g., image files).
  
  - **Implication**: While you won't see these requests in the access logs, any errors (like 404s) will still be logged if you have error logging enabled.
